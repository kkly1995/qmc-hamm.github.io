At each length scale of interest, advanced tools exist.
Our collaboration contains experts at each of these length scales. 
Our goal is to systematically link the microscopic to the mesoscopic by using well-defined data interfaces. 
The highly accurate, sub-atomic scale quantum Monte Carlo calculations produce data, which is then used to understand the physics at the atomic scale, and so on. 
Reproducibility and documentation are achieved by using modern scientific computing methods.
