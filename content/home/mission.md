A major theme of condensed matter and materials physics is the relationship between the microscopic behavior of electrons and nuclei to the emergent low-energy mesoscopic behavior of materials.
Elucidating this relationship is a challenge, since the microscopic model requires advanced solution methods for many-body quantum mechanics, and the mesoscopic picture can be rather complicated.
In complex materials, standard concepts at the mesoscopic level such as phonons, spins, and electron-like excitations can interact in complex ways which are difficult to access experimentally. 

The state of the art in creating mesoscopic models starting from microscopic behavior is based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
In recent years, modern machine learning techniques have been able to reproduce potential energy surfaces from standard DFT functionals to a very high accuracy; the accuracy potential energy surfaces can be limited by the underlying data. 
In quantum materials such as twisted bilayer graphene,(pictured above) interactions between electronic excitations can be critical to their behavior. 
To resolve the above issues, it is necessary to move beyond density functional theory and to base mesoscopic models on more accurate microscopic calculations. 
In this project, we will use quantum Monte Carlo calculations as a base for high-impact projects which can benefit from the extra accuracy.
