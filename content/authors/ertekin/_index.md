The most important thing to know about me is the I have one of the best jobs in the world. I have the pleasure and privilege of working with several bright young researchers to make developments and advances in areas that I am passionate about. If you want to know the formal stuff, here is my CV and here are my Google Scholar and Researcher-ID pages. In our group, we are interested in using computational methods - any or all of them - to understand and design new materials and material systems across a wide variety of applications such as photovoltaics, catalysis, heat transport, etc. Our work is highly interdisciplinary: most physicists think I’m an engineer, and most engineers think I’m a physicist. At the University of Illinois, we have access to some of the world’s best high-performance computing facilities, which allows us to be very ambitious about the types of problems that we choose to work on. My other interests: I also train and play capoeira angola.
