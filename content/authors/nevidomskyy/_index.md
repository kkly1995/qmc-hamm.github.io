Dr. Andriy Nevidomskyy is an expert in theoretical condensed matter physics,
working in the field of strong electron correlations in quantum materials. The
collective behaviour of electrons in such materials often results in the
emergence of new exotic quantum phases, such as the unconventional
superconducti­vity. Nevidomskyy is working on the heavy fermion materials and a
new class of iron-based supercon­duc­tors, and is particularly interested in
the novel quantum phases emerging in frustrated magnets. Originally from
Ukraine, he received his PhD in physics from Cambridge University in the UK,
before moving to Université de Sherbrooke in Canada as a postdoctoral fellow to
work on high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Prior to joining Rice in
2010, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Materials Theory at
Rutgers University, conducting research into heavy fermion materials. He is the
recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and the Cottrell Scholar Award from Research
Corporation for Science Advancement.
