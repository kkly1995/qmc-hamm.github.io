	abstract = {The parameter derivative of the expectation value of the energy, \${\textbackslash}partial E/{\textbackslash}partial p\$, is a key ingredient in variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) wave function optimization methods. In some cases, a na{\textbackslash}"ive Monte Carlo estimate of this derivative suffers from an infinite variance which inhibits the efficiency of optimization methods that rely on a stable estimate of the derivative. In this work, we derive a simple regularization of the na{\textbackslash}"ive estimator which is trivial to implement in existing VMC codes, has finite variance, and a negligible bias which can be extrapolated to zero bias with no extra cost. We use this estimator to construct an unbiased, finite variance estimation of \${\textbackslash}partial E/{\textbackslash}partial p\$ for a multi-Slater-Jastrow trial wave function on the LiH molecule. This regularized estimator is a simple and efficient estimator of \${\textbackslash}partial E/{\textbackslash}partial p\$ for VMC optimization techniques.},
