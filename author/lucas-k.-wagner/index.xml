In some cases, a naive estimate of this derivative suffers from an infinite variance which inhibits the efficiency of optimization methods that rely on a stable estimate of the derivative.
In this work, we derive a simple regularization of the naive estimator which is trivial to implement in existing VMC codes, has finite variance, and a negligible bias which can be extrapolated to zero bias with no extra cost.
We use this estimator to construct an unbiased, finite variance estimation of $\partial E/\partial p$ for a multi-Slater-Jastrow trial wave function on the LiH molecule and in the optimization of a multi-Slater-Jastrow trial wave function on the CuO molecule.
This regularized estimator is a simple and efficient estimator of $\partial E/\partial p$ for VMC optimization techniques.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Accurate tight-binding model for twisted bilayer graphene describes topological flat bands without geometric relaxation</title><link>/publication/pathak-tbmodel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publication/pathak-tbmodel/</guid><description>&lt;p>A major hurdle in understanding the phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is the roles of lattice relaxation and electronic structure on isolated band flattening near magic twist angles. In this work, the authors develop an accurate local environment tight-binding model fit to tight-binding parameters computed from ab initio density-functional theory calculations across many atomic configurations. With the accurate parametrization, it is found that the magic angle shifts to slightly lower angles than often quoted, from around 1.05∘ to around 0.99∘, and that isolated flat bands appear for rigidly rotated graphene layers, with enhancement of the flat bands when the layers are allowed to distort. Study of the orbital localization supports the emergence of fragile topology in the isolated flat bands without the need for lattice relaxation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Excited States in Variational Monte Carlo Using a Penalty Method</title><link>/publication/pathak-excited_states/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publication/pathak-excited_states/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article, the authors present a technique using variational Monte Carlo to solve for excited states of electronic systems. This technique is based on enforcing orthogonality to lower energy states, which results in a simple variational principle for the excited states. Energy optimization is then used to solve for the excited states. This technique is applied to the well-characterized benzene molecule, in which ∼10,000 parameters are optimized for the first 12 excited states. Agreement within ∼0.2 eV is obtained with higher scaling coupled cluster methods; small disagreements with experiment are likely due to vibrational effects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
