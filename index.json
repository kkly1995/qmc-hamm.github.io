The collective behaviour of electrons in such materials often results in the emergence of new exotic quantum phases, such as the unconventional superconducti­vity. Nevidomskyy is working on the heavy fermion materials and a new class of iron-based supercon­duc­tors, and is particularly interested in the novel quantum phases emerging in frustrated magnets. Originally from Ukraine, he received his PhD in physics from Cambridge University in the UK, before moving to Université de Sherbrooke in Canada as a postdoctoral fellow to work on high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Prior to joining Rice in 2010, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Center for Materials Theory at Rutgers University, conducting research into heavy fermion materials. He is the recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and the Cottrell Scholar Award from Research Corporation for Science Advancement.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4b105ffc856bf11e49c6c61c4a9cbad5","permalink":"/author/andriy-nevidomskyy/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/andriy-nevidomskyy/","section":"authors","summary":"Dr. Andriy Nevidomskyy is an expert in theoretical condensed matter physics, working in the field of strong electron correlations in quantum materials.

I have the pleasure and privilege of working with several bright young researchers to make developments and advances in areas that I am passionate about. If you want to know the formal stuff, here is my CV and here are my Google Scholar and Researcher-ID pages. In our group, we are interested in using computational methods - any or all of them - to understand and design new materials and material systems across a wide variety of applications such as photovoltaics, catalysis, heat transport, etc. Our work is highly interdisciplinary: most physicists think I’m an engineer, and most engineers think I’m a physicist. At the University of Illinois, we have access to some of the world’s best high-performance computing facilities, which allows us to be very ambitious about the types of problems that we choose to work on. My other interests: I also train and play capoeira angola.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6ac6e8904a061054594f340ac75ba3ae","permalink":"/author/elif-ertekin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/elif-ertekin/","section":"authors","summary":"The most important thing to know about me is the I have one of the best jobs in the world.

His group works on applications in many areas, including solar energy, microelectronics, sensing and detection, and materials processing. Their work relies on atomistic and continuum modeling methods to simulate multiphysics phenomena, with the goal of helping to design and interpret experiments. Professor Johnson and his research group study such topics as: mechanics of quantum dots, including the effects of stress on their formation and properties; the development of stress in MEMS devices and microelectronic materials due to ion-bombardment processing; dislocations in electronic materials; the electrical properties of deformed carbon nanotubes; nanoscale surface instabilities; and nanophotonic design of surfaces, coatings, and microstructures.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9ef8089a7ff7d6b5e610fd081e81bfd7","permalink":"/author/harley-johnson/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/harley-johnson/","section":"authors","summary":"Professor Johnson studies the mechanics of electronic and photonic materials, the mechanics of nanostructures, and optical properties of materials.
