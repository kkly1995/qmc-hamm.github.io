In our group, we are interested in using computational methods - any or all of them - to understand and design new materials and material systems across a wide variety of applications such as photovoltaics, catalysis, heat transport, etc. Our work is highly interdisciplinary: most physicists think I’m an engineer, and most engineers think I’m a physicist. At the University of Illinois, we have access to some of the world’s best high-performance computing facilities, which allows us to be very ambitious about the types of problems that we choose to work on.

The continuum formulation is based on the topological constraints introduced by the periodic dislocation network associated with the moiré structure. The approach is based on solving analytically for the structural distortion and displacement fields that satisfy the topological constraints and that minimize the total energy. The total energy is described by both the strain energy of each individual distorted layer and a Peierls-Nabarro-like interfacial contribution arising from stacking disregistry. The dislocation core emerges naturally within the formalism as a result of the competition between the two contributions. The approach presented here captures the structure and energetics of twist and stretch moiré superlattices of dislocations with arbitrary direction and character, without assuming an analytical solution a priori and while accounting naturally for dislocation-dislocation image interactions. In comparisons to atomistic simulations using classical potentials, the maximum structure deviation is 6%, while the maximum line energy deviation is 0.019 eV/Å. Several applications of our model are shown, including predicting the variation of structure with twist angle and describing dislocation line tension and junction energies.\n","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"eec9d059084fa1d9dc2664135815cc53","permalink":"/publication/annevelink-dislocation/","publishdate":"2020-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/annevelink-dislocation/","section":"publication","summary":"We develop a continuum dislocation description of twist and stretch moiré superlattices in two-dimensional material bilayers.
